Practical examples
==================

Tutorials
---------

- Aperiodic data (realistic survey geometry) with jackknife shot-noise tuning: :root:`tutorial.ipynb`

    - Uses a BOSS DR12 FastPM mock
    - This tutorial is also available as scripts (which seem more practical to run) in :root:`tutorial/`. `The Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/oliverphilcox/RascalC/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb>`_ may be more useful for explanations along the way.

Example script gallery
----------------------

There is a dedicated repository: `cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts <https://github.com/cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts>`_. `A typical directory's contents are described in the README <https://github.com/cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts?tab=readme-ov-file#common-files>`_. Some highlights:

    - `DESI DR2 (Y3) data scripts <https://github.com/cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts/tree/main/DESI/Y3>`_ (single tracers `before <https://github.com/cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts/tree/main/DESI/Y3/pre>`_ and `after standard BAO reconstruction <https://github.com/cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts/tree/main/DESI/Y3/post>`_)
    - `DESI 2024 (DR1, Y1) data scripts <https://github.com/cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts/tree/main/DESI/Y1>`_ (single tracers `before <https://github.com/cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts/tree/main/DESI/Y1/pre>`_ and `after standard BAO reconstruction <https://github.com/cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts/tree/main/DESI/Y1/post>`_)
    - `BOSS data examples <https://github.com/cosmodesi/RascalC-scripts/tree/main/BOSS>`_ may be more useful for people outside of DESI
