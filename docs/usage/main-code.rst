Covariance Matrix Estimation
=============================

Overview
----------

This is the main section of RascalC, where 2PCF or 3PCF covariance matrix estimates are computed via Monte Carlo integration from a given set of input particles. For the 2PCF, depending on the number of input fields the code will compute either components for a single covariance matrix or all required components for 6 cross-covariance matrices (i.e. for multi-tracer analysis).

**Prerequisites**:

- In JACKKNIFE mode (including LEGENDRE_MIX mode with JACKKNIFE), the jackknife weights and binned pair counts must be computed via the :doc:`jackknife-weights` script before the C++ code is run.
- In DEFAULT mode, or LEGENDRE_MIX mode without JACKKNIFE, the RR pair counts must be computed via the :ref:`RR_counts` script before the C++ code is run.
- In LEGENDRE and 3PCF modes, the survey correction functions :math:`\Phi` must be computed via the :ref:`survey_correction_2PCF` script before the C++ code is run.
- In LEGENDRE_MIX mode, the projection coefficients from :math:`\mu` bins to Legendre multipoles musst be computed via the :ref:`mu_bin_legendre_factors` script before the C++ code is run.

.. _particle-grid:

Particle Grid and Cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the code, the particles are divided up into many cells for efficient computation, with each containing :math:`\sim10` random particles. A cuboidal grid of cells is constructed aligned with the :math:`(x,y,z)` axes, which fully encompasses all random particles. The cellsize is set by the the :math:`N_\mathrm{side}` parameter, which gives the number of (cubic) cells along the largest dimension along the box. This must be an odd integer, and the code will automatically exit if :math:`N_\mathrm{side}` is too small or too large (since this gives inefficient performance).

.. _covariance-precision:

Covariance Matrix Precision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The precision of covariance matrix estimators can be user-controlled in the RascalC code. To understand these parameters we must briefly outline the selection of random quads of particles (denoted :math:`\{i,j,k,l\}`) used in the Monte Carlo integration. The particle selection algorithm has the following form:

1. Loop over all :math:`i`-particles :math:`N_\mathrm{loops}` times. Each loop is independent and can be run on separate cores.
2. For each :math:`i` particle, we pick :math:`N_2` :math:`j`-particles at random, according to some selection rule. Here we compute the 2-point contribution to the covariance matrix, if we are computing a 2PCF covariance.
3. For each :math:`j` particle, we pick :math:`N_3` :math:`k`-particles at random, according to some selection rule. Here we compute the 3-point contribution to the covariance matrix.
4. For each :math:`k` particle, we pick :math:`N_4` :math:`l`-particles at random, according to some selection rule. Here we compute the 4-point contribution to the covariance matrix.
5. *(3PCF mode only)*: For each :math:`l` particle, we pick :math:`N_5` :math:`m`-particles at random, according to some selection rule. Here we compute the 5-point contribution to the 3PCF covariance matrix.
6. *(3PCF mode only)*: For each :math:`m` particle, we pick :math:`N_6` :math:`n`-particles at random, according to some selection rule. Here we compute the 6-point contribution to the 3PCF covariance matrix.

By setting the parameters :math:`(N_\mathrm{loops},N_2, N_3, N_4,[N_5,N_6])` we can control the precision of each matrix component. Standard values of :math:`N_2\sim N_3\sim N_4 [\sim N_5 \sim N_6] \sim 10` normally work well. Each loop of the code produces an independent estimate of the full covariance matrix, which can be used to create accurate inverse matrices and effective number of mock calculations. The covariance converges relatively fast, so setting :math:`N_\mathrm{loops}`
to a few times the number of cores should work well. Values of :math:`N_\mathrm{loops}\gtrsim 100` should be avoided to stop file sizes and reconstruction times becoming large.

Note that we require a relatively large value of :math:`N_2N_3N_4N_\mathrm{loops}` for the output matrices to converge, in particular if we wish to invert the matrices. If the output matrices are not sufficiently converged, the reconstruction scripts (:doc:`post-processing`) will fail.

Usage
------

The code is used as follows, with the command line options specified below:

.. code-block:: bash

    make
    ./cov [OPTIONS]

The first line produces the ``./cov`` file by compiling the code; running ``make clean`` is not necessary in most cases since recompilation is invoked automatically when needed depending on changes in source files. The Makefile may need to be altered depending on the particular computational configuration used. The default Makefile is for a standard Unix installation, with the ``Makefile_mac`` file giving a sample Makefile for a Mac installation. This uses the following optional flags in the Makefile;

- ``-DOPENMP``: (Recommended) Run code in parallel with OpenMP, using the OpenMP installation specfied by the ``-lgomp`` and ``-fopenmp`` flags.
- ``-DPERIODIC``: Use periodic boundary conditions (appropriate for a cubic simulation box, but not mock surveys).
- ``-DJACKKNIFE``: Compute both full-survey and jackknife 2PCF covariance matrix terms, allowing for shot-noise-rescaling calibration from the survey itself.
- ``-DLEGENDRE``: Compute the full-survey covariance matrix terms for (even) Legendre multipoles of the 2PCF accumulated directly. Incompatible with jackknives.
- ``-DLEGENDRE_MIX``: Compute the full-survey covariance matrix terms for (even) Legendre multipoles of the 2PCF projected from (a typically large number of) :math:`mu` bins (estimated in this way in `pycorr <https://py2pcf.readthedocs.io>`, for example). Compatible with jackknives; all the counts should be computed with sufficiently large number of :math:`mu` bins, ideally as many of them as the Legendre multipoles are projected from. For jackknife covariance, the disconnected term is dropped (should not make a significant difference since the term has been found tiny in practice).
- ``-DTHREE_PCF``: Compute the full-survey covariance matrix terms for (even and odd) Legendre multipoles of the isotropic 3PCF.
- DEFAULT mode refers to the case when neither ``LEGENDRE`` (nor ``LEGENDRE_MIX``) nor ``THREE_PCF`` are enabled. Then the covariance is computed for :math:`(r,\mu)`-binned correlation function.

**NB**: For a summary of input command line parameters, simply run ``./cov`` with no arguments.

.. _code-output:

Code Output
-----------

In the specified output directory, RascalC creates the directories ``3PCFCovMatricesAll/`` (3PCF mode), ``CovMatricesAll/`` (DEFAULT, LEGENDRE and JACKKNIFE modes) and ``CovMatricesJack/`` (JACKKNIFE mode) containing the relevant output matrix estimates. These contain multiple estimates of the each part of the total matrix and should be reconstructed using the :doc:`post-processing` scripts.

The full output files take the following form (for N radial bins, M angular bins, maximum Legendre bin L and J non-zero jackknife regions, with FIELDS specifying the utilized tracer fields):

*3PCF or LEGENDRE mode*:

- ``c{X}_n{N}_l{L}_{FIELDS}_{I}.txt``: I-th estimate of the X-point covariance matrix estimates, i.e. :math:`{}^X\mathbf{C}`. The summed covariance matrix terms have the suffix 'full'.
- ``binct_c{X}_n{N}_l{L}_{FIELDS}_{I}.txt``: Total used counts per bin for the X-point covariance matrix.
- ``total_counts_n{N}_l{L}_{FIELDS}_{I}``: Total number of sets of particles attempted for the summed integral.

*DEFAULT or JACKKNIFE mode*:

 - ``c{X}_n{N}_m{M}_j{J}_{FIELDS}_{I}.txt``: I-th estimate of the X-point covariance matrix estimates, i.e. :math:`C_{X,ab}` The summed covariance matrix has the suffix 'full'.
 - ``RR_n{N}_m{M}_{FIELDS}_{I}.txt``: I-th estimate of the (non-jackknife) :math:`RR_{ab}^{XY}` pair counts which can be compared with Corrfunc.
 - ``binct_c{X}_n{N}_m{M}_{FIELDS}.txt``: Total used counts per bin for the X-point covariance matrix.
 - ``total_counts_n{N}_m{M}_{FIELDS}.txt``: Total number of pairs, triples and quads attempted for the summed integral.

 *JACKKNIFE mode only*:

 - ``RR{P}_n{N}_m{M}_{FIELDS}.txt``: Estimate of :math:`RR_{ab}` pair count for particles in random-subset P (:math:`P\in[1,2]`).  This is used to compute the disconnected jackknife matrix term.
 - ``EE{P}_n{N}_m{M}_{FIELDS}.txt``: Estimate of :math:`EE_{ab}` :math:`\xi`-weighted pair count for particles in random-subset P. This is also used for the disconnected jackknife matrix term.

Each file is an ASCII format file containing the relevant matrices with the collapsed bin indices :math:`\mathrm{bin}_\mathrm{collapsed} = \mathrm{bin}_\mathrm{radial}\times n_\mu + \mathrm{bin}_\mathrm{angular}` (2PCF) or :math:`\mathrm{bin}_\mathrm{collapsed} = \left(\mathrm{bin}_\mathrm{radial,1}\times n_r + \mathrm{bin}_\mathrm{radial,2}\right)\times n_\mu + \mathrm{bin}_\mathrm{angular}` (3PCF) for a total of :math:`n_\mu` angular (or Legendre) bins and :math:`n_r` radial bins.
